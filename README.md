# Cash-VSU Fee Tracking System

### Overview
Cash-VSU is a fee tracking and payment management system inspired by Cavite State University (CvSU). It was conceptualized during the COVID-19 pandemic to address the challenges of in-person transactions. While actual online payment functionality is not implemented, the system provides a user-friendly interface for students to track and manage their fees, while also offering an admin dashboard for school operators to oversee the fee management process.
